Purpose:
This program will return the k-th smallest value in a binary serach tree.

Inputs:
Please run this program using the makefile command 'make run.'

The user will first be asked if they would like to use the default data set. The user must type 'yes' or 'no' (case sensitive).

If the user types 'no,' then they will be asked to input a k; the user should type an integer between 1 and the listed upper range (in this case, 15).

If the user types 'yes,' then they are asked to input an integer for data set size and an integer for a seed (for random data set generation). The user will then be asked to input an upper limit for the data set; the upper limit must be an integer greater than 0.
Then, the user is asked to input a k. Once again, please type an integer between 1 and the size of the data set.

Outputs:
The user is printed the unsorted array. Then, the user is printed the binary tree using an in-order traversal (values will appear to be printed in numeric order).

Then, the user is printed the k-th smallest value. For example, if the user inputted the k-value to be 1, then the user is returned the smallest value. If the user inputs the k-value as 3, then the user is returned the 3-rd smallest value.
